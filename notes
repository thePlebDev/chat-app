- the packet.json file acts as the Node project manifest. It holds the projects name, version number, description and other
information. this file can be created by hand but it is easier if you let npm do it for you.
- you will create the packet.json with the npm init command.

npm scripts
- the scripts label are commands that you might need to run again and again
- you type in the keys into the command prompt, so npm start, to start the application and npm test to test the application
- when you are using custom scripts you must call the command npm run customScript, the reason that npm test and run work
is because that node assumes that those commands will exist
